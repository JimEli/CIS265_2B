# Pima CC CIS265 Week #2 Project B

Write a program that translates an alphabetic phone number into numeric form:
```text
   Enter phone number: CALLATT
   2255288
```
(In case you donâ€™t have a telephone nearby, here are the letters on the keys: 2=ABC, 3=DEF, 4=GHI, 5=JKL, 6=MNO, 7=PRS, 8=TUV, 9=WXY.) If the original phone number contains nonalphabetic characters (digits or punctuation, for example), leave them unchanged.
